SECTION 2
    Command line usage

    The game has a command line that can be accessed by pressing '/'. Note that entering command mode DOES NOT BLOCK player movement. As of writing there are few commands.

    - /showfps 

    This will toggle an FPS Counter in the top-left corner

    - /load <levelname>

    This will cause the game to restart and load the level specified using <levelname>. Entering a non-existent filename won't do anything.

    - /generate <x> <y>

    This will generate a random level with dimensions specified by <x> and <y>. The filename is randomly generated. Upon creation, the game will automatically load the level.
